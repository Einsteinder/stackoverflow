## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2019 to better understand:

1. How developers satisfy their job/career around world?
2. How is the income like in different countries?
3. What is the most popular social media among developers? How about their income?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is a notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@einsteinder/chinese-have-highest-income-b3aa98dd3e6f).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Stack Overflow link available [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
